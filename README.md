# Typst Template for a Computer Science Master's Thesis

This template has University of Helsinki branding and the masters-level,
faculty, library name etc. are hard-coded, so it's not usable as-is, unless
you are writing a Computer Science master's thesis at University of Helsinki.

[An example PDF is available here](https://gustafla.github.io/csm-thesis-typst-template-hy/example.pdf).
